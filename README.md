# Suspended!

Since Xcode 9, there's a bug that it shows wrong suggestions in auto-completion, which Eltaso heavily relies on. And this bug still isn't fixed yet in Xcode 10.2. So I decided to suspend this project, until this bug being fixed.

You can find details about this bug here:
https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5466
